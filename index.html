    <center><p>Once upon a time, an amazing business idea began by combining one person's love for sweets and a passion for healthy ecosystems. Our Founder, Pat has developed a delicious recipe for a coffee-time confection called Salmon Cookies. These cookies are made into the shape of a salmon and are suitable for both humans and salmon to enjoy. Salmon Cookies taste good and are also good for the Earth!</p></center>
